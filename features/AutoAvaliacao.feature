Feature: Self-evaluation
    As a Student
    I want to self assess with concepts that I find consistent with my knowledge in each goal
    So that my grade expectation can be compared to the teacher's assessment.


Scenario: Evaluating yourself
    Given I’m logged as a student at the “Auto-Avaliação” page
    And I see the goals “Entender conceitos de Requisitos”, “Especificar Requisitos com qualidade” to be self-rated
    When I add grade “MA” for goal “Entender conceitos de Requisitos” 
    And “MPA” for goal “Especificar Requisitos com qualidade”
    Then I’m at the “Auto-Avaliação” page
    And I can see a confirmation message
    And I see my assess “MA” with the teacher’s assessment “MPA” for goal “Entender conceitos de Requisitos”
    And my assess “MPA” with the teacher’s assessment “MPA” for goal “Especificar Requisitos com qualidade”


Scenario: Evaluating yourself
    Given I’m logged as a student at the “Auto-Avaliação” page
    And I see the goals “Entender conceitos de Requisitos”, “Especificar Requisitos com qualidade” to be self-rated
    When I add grade “MA” for goal “Entender conceitos de Requisitos” 
    Then I’m at the “Auto-Avaliação” page
    And I can see the error message “Todas as metas têm que ser avaliadas”
    And I only see the teacher’s assessment “MPA” on “Entender conceitos de Requisitos” goal and “MPA” on “Especificar Requisitos com qualidade” goal.
    And I can start the self evaluation again.


Scenario: Analysing discrepant assessments
    Given I’m logged as a teacher at the “Auto-Avaliação do Aluno” page
    And I see the class with  “Caio Marcus” with 1 concept discrepant in 5 goals
    And “Fabio Queiroz” with none discrepant concepts
    And “Isabela Araújo” with none discrepant concepts
    When I look to the discrepancy rate
    And it is zero percent
    Then I’m at the “Auto-Avaliação do Aluno” page
    And the assessment in "Requisitos" is appropriate.


Scenario: Analysing discrepant assessments
    Given I’m logged as a teacher at the “Auto-Avaliação do Aluno” page
    And I see the class with  “Caio Marcus” with 1 concept discrepant in 5 goals
    And “Fabio Queiroz” with none discrepant concepts
    And “Fernando Filipine” with 3 concepts discrepant in 5 goals
    When I look to the discrepancy rate
    And it is 33 percent of the class
    And I see the list of students with discrepant assessments
    Then I’m at the “Auto-Avaliação do Aluno” page
    And I see “Fernando Filipine” in the list
    And the assessments are discrepant in "Requisitos" goal
    And I can reevaluating his goals.

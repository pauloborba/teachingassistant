Feature: Student self-evaluation
As a Teacher of a specific course
I want to allow students to self-evaluate on all learning goals said course possesses
So that relevant feedback regarding overall student growth, teaching methods and their effectiveness can be gathered.

Scenario: Performing a successful self-evaluation process as a student
Given that I am at the “Student” page
And I see no grades for any learning goals on the “Self-evaluation” section
When I select “Perform self-evaluation”
And input “MA, MANA and MPA” according to my perceived performance in each goal
And confirm the conclusion the evaluation
Then I see a message signaling I was successful
And I’m still at the “Student” page
And I can see the grades “MA, MANA and MPA” I input before displayed on the “Self-evaluation” section.

And now the system has “MA, MANA and MPA” in the respective learning goals stored on the self-evaluation section of my profile.
